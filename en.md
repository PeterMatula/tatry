# Map of the Tatra Mountains

[üá∏üá∞ Slovensky](README.md)

The goal of the *Map of Tatra Mountains* project is to create an amazing map of the highest Slovak and Polish mountain range, which will be:

* *free*: available for free, subject to compliance with simple [license terms](License-and-Copyright)
* *modern*: shared in an arbitrarily scalable vector format
* *detailed*: containing a large amount of geographic data
* *accurate*: corresponding (with few [exceptions](About-the-map)) to the real world
* *complete*: shows the entire mountain range, not just its central/Slovak part
* *mountaineering*: contains all locations important for climbing and mountaineering

In short, the map wants to be a work of art that, when hung on the wall, will bring joy to lovers of the Tatras. At the same time, you can use it when planning your next adventure.

The map is only available in electronic form. It is not in the author's power, nor to the taste, to arrange its physical production and distribution. You can download the map and have it printed at the nearest copy center. If you like the result, you can [reward](Support) the author at your discretion.

The table contains several versions of the map. Choose the one that you like best. Whichever one you choose, have it printed in color, in the highest possible quality (dpi), on a quality printer, and paper of reasonable quality/thickness. A good copy center will certainly be happy to advise you.

The primary map format is A0. If this size is too big for you, you can use the A1 format (here I would choose a more readable font, see below). Going to even smaller sizes makes no sense, the text will become unreadable. On the other hand, with a little technical skill, you can scale up the map to any size without losing quality. For example, to the full width (approx. 90 cm, total size approx. 160 x 90 cm) of commonly available large-format printers. Or you can use the map to wallpaper your living room or put it on a highway billboard, vector graphics don't care.

Furthermore, the map is available in two font versions. In the classic, typeface and more readable sans-serif font [Ubuntu](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Ubuntu). And in a daring, hand-written, less legible, but overall very well-fitting font [Virgil](https://virgil.excalidraw.com/) (the author's favorite).

The last division is into versions. The first public version is `v1.0`, its fixes and small improvements will be `v1.X`, and any future major changes `vX.Y`.
